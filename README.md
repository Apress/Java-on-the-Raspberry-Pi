# Java-on-the-Raspberry-Pi

You can find the source code for Chapters 6-14 and all appendices in thie repository. You can also find a movie of the Metronome project.

- The **src** folder contains the source code for all NetBeans projects using Ant as the build tool (Chapters 6-14 and Appendices A1 and A2).
- The **led** and **led-test** folders contain the source code for the NetBeans using Maven as the build tool (Appendix A3).
- The **Metronome 1. mp4** file is the Metronome movie. GitHub file size restrictions forced a low resolution version; my apologies.
